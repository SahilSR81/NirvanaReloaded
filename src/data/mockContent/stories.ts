    content: "An old Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, 'My son, the battle is between two wolves. One is Evil - it is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other is Good - it is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.' The grandson thought about it and asked, 'Which wolf wins?' The old Cherokee replied, 'The one you feed.'",
