            const weekStart = startOfWeek(entry.timestamp.toDate());
            const weekKey = format(weekStart, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
            
            if (!acc[weekKey]) {
                acc[weekKey] = { sum: 0, count: 0 };
            }
            
            acc[weekKey].sum += entry.moodScore;
            acc[weekKey].count += 1;
            
            return acc;
        }, {} as Record<string, { sum: number; count: number }>);

        return Object.entries(weeklyAverages).map(([week, data]) => ({
            week,
            averageMood: data.sum / data.count
        }));
    }

    private async analyzeActivityImpact(userId: string): Promise<ActivityImpact[]> {
        const activitiesRef = collection(this.db, 'userActivities');
        const q = query(
            activitiesRef,
            where('userId', '==', userId),
            orderBy('timestamp', 'desc'),
            limit(100)
        );

        const snapshot = await getDocs(q);

        return this.calculateActivityCorrelations(activities);
    }
}

```

### Performance Optimization Implementation

```typescript
export class CacheManager {
    private cache: Map<string, CacheEntry>;
    private readonly maxAge: number;

    constructor(maxAge: number = 5 * 60 * 1000) { // 5 minutes default
        this.cache = new Map();
        this.maxAge = maxAge;
    }

    async get<T>(key: string, fetchFn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
        const cached = this.cache.get(key);
        
        if (cached && !this.isExpired(cached)) {
            return cached.data as T;
        }

        const data = await fetchFn();
        this.set(key, data);
        return data;
    }

    private set(key: string, data: any): void {
        this.cache.set(key, {
            data,
            timestamp: Date.now()
        });

        // Clean up old entries
        if (this.cache.size > 100) {
            this.cleanup();
        }
    }

    private isExpired(entry: CacheEntry): boolean {
        return Date.now() - entry.timestamp > this.maxAge;
    }

    private cleanup(): void {
        const now = Date.now();
        for (const [key, entry] of this.cache.entries()) {
            if (now - entry.timestamp > this.maxAge) {
                this.cache.delete(key);
            }
        }
    }
}

```

class PerformanceTest {
    private metrics: PerformanceMetrics = {
        loadTime: [],
        responseTime: [],
        renderTime: []
    };

    async measurePageLoad(url: string): Promise<void> {
        const start = performance.now();
        
        // Simulate page load
        await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });
        
        const end = performance.now();
        this.metrics.loadTime.push(end - start);
    }

    async measureComponentRender(selector: string): Promise<void> {
        const start = performance.now();
        
        // Wait for component to render
        await page.waitForSelector(selector);
        
        const end = performance.now();
        this.metrics.renderTime.push(end - start);
    }

    async measureApiResponse(endpoint: string): Promise<void> {
        const start = performance.now();
        
        // Make API call
        await fetch(endpoint);
        
        const end = performance.now();
        this.metrics.responseTime.push(end - start);
    }

    generateReport(): PerformanceReport {
        return {
            averageLoadTime: this.calculateAverage(this.metrics.loadTime),
            averageResponseTime: this.calculateAverage(this.metrics.responseTime),
            averageRenderTime: this.calculateAverage(this.metrics.renderTime)
        };
    }

    private calculateAverage(numbers: number[]): number {
        return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / numbers.length;
    }
}

```

### Security Testing

Security Test Implementation:

```typescript
describe('Security Features', () => {
    describe('Authentication Security', () => {
        it('should prevent unauthorized access to protected routes', async () => {
            // Attempt to access protected route without authentication
            const response = await fetch('/api/protected-data');
            expect(response.status).toBe(401);
        });

        it('should validate token expiration', async () => {
            const expiredToken = generateExpiredToken();
            const response = await fetch('/api/protected-data', {
                headers: {
                    Authorization: `Bearer ${expiredToken}`
                }
            });
            expect(response.status).toBe(401);
        });
    });

    describe('Data Security', () => {
        it('should encrypt sensitive data', async () => {
            const sensitiveData = 'sensitive information';
            const encryptedData = await encryptData(sensitiveData);
            
            // Verify data is encrypted
            expect(encryptedData).not.toBe(sensitiveData);
            
            // Verify data can be decrypted
            const decryptedData = await decryptData(encryptedData);
            expect(decryptedData).toBe(sensitiveData);
        });
    });
});
